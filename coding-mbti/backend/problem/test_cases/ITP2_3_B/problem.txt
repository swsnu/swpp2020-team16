output_desc::"The input is given in the following format. In the first line, n (the number of elements in A) is given. In the second line, ai (each element in A) are given. In the third line, the number of queries q is given and each query is given in the following q lines. comi denotes a type of query. 0 and 1 represents min(b,e) and max(b,e) respectively."
desc::"For each query, print the minimum element or the maximum element in a line."
