# Swapping Two Numbers
Write a program which reads two integers x and y, and prints them in ascending order.
# Input
The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset consists of two integers x and y separated by a single space.
The input ends with two 0 (when both x and y are zero). Your program should not process for these terminal symbols.
# Output
For each dataset, print x and y in ascending order in a line. Put a single space between x and y.
# Constraints
0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10000
the number of datasets ≤ 3000`;
