title::"How many ways?"
input_desc::"The input consists of multiple datasets. For each dataset, two integers n and x are given in a line. The input ends with two zeros for n and x respectively. Your program should not process for these terminal symbols."
output_desc::"For each dataset, print the number of combinations in a line."
desc::"Write a program which identifies the number of combinations of three integers which satisfy the following conditions:You should select three distinct integers from 1 to n. A total sum of the three integers is x. For example, there are two combinations for n = 5 and x = 9. 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, 2 + 3 + 4 = 9"
